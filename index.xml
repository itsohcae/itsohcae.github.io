      <description>Stigmatization of menstrual cycles conceals period poverty on a global scale. Period or menstrual poverty is defined as when those who experience monthly cycles do not have their adequate menstrual hygiene management (MHM) needs met. These needs include access to sanitary products, washing facilities, waste management, pain killers, and information about menstruation.1 The COVID-19 pandemic is demonstrating the importance of this understudied dimension of poverty and inequality. Each day during this pandemic, an estimated 800 million women and girls are menstruating worldwide.</description>

      <description>Shields.io is a massive library of badges that can be inserted into project README&amp;rsquo;s or websites displaying various statuses (code coverage, health, version, etc). Support for docker was missing the current build health, and was a pretty trivial addition.</description>

      <description>Intro Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether it&amp;rsquo;s a CakePHP app for a client, your own personal CMS, or any other web based application. If your passing around passwords or other sensitive info you should really implement SSL. SSL provides 2 main perks to your visitors.
 First it encrypts all communication that flies across the web. This prevents curious or devious billies from getting your secrets. Secondly it ensures to the user that your server is in fact who it claims, and not a nasty &amp;lsquo;man in the middle&amp;quot; attack.</description>
